# Lights

### System Operation: 
During normal operation, the traffic light should be Green and the Pedestrian light should
be Red (Standby State). When a pedestrian arrives at the crossing and presses the Pedestrian button, the
Green traffic light should turn Red to halt the flow of traffic. The Red Pedestrian light should turn Green to
allow pedestrians to cross the road. The Red traffic light and Green pedestrian lights should remain ON for 1 minute and then return to their original states i.e. Red traffic light returns to Green and the Green pedestrian
light returns to Red until the next time the Pedestrian button is pressed.
